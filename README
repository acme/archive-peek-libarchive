NAME
    Archive::Peek::Libarchive - Peek into archives without extracting them
    (using libarchive)

SYNOPSIS
      use Archive::Peek::External;
      my $peek = Archive::Peek::External->new( filename => 'archive.tgz' );
      my @files = $peek->files();
      my $contents = $peek->file('README.txt')

DESCRIPTION
    This module lets you peek into archives without extracting them. This is
    a wrapper to the libarchive C libary
    (http://code.google.com/p/libarchive/), which you must have installed
    (libarchive-dev package for Debian/Ubuntu). It supports many different
    archive formats and compression algorithms and is fast.

METHODS
  new
    The constructor takes the filename of the archive to peek into:

      my $peek = Archive::Peek::External->new( filename => 'archive.tgz' );

  files
    Returns the files in the archive:

      my @files = $peek->files();

  file
    Returns the contents of a file in the archive:

      my $contents = $peek->file('README.txt')
